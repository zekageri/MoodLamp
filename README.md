# MoodLamp
This is a MoodLamp Project for the koma's

What will it do:
 It is a MoodLamp. It will bring mood to your room. hehe

  - WiFi AP mode with captiveportal ( Thanks to Me_no_Dev for the AsyncWeb )
  - Change Animations on the web at runtime
  - Change Color on the web at runtime
  - Variable brightness on the fly ( at animation run or static color )
  - Variable auto turn on with favourite color or animation at defined time every day ( in progress )
  - Create custom animations on the web ( in progress )
  
  The lamp will optionally remember the last adjusted animation and brightness and it will return to it at bootup.
